# ramshead-website

Hi all!

This is a git repo for the Ram's Head website, mostly for backup/catastrophe purposes. 
The repo is owned by Nisha Masharani (EP 2014-2015), who can be reached at 
nmasharani@gmail.com. To make a backup, simply run:

$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m "[insert your own commit message here, e.g. 2014-2015 backup]"
$ git push origin master

on the command line.
You have to have a github.com account in order to run the last command.
If you're a webmaster and need help/are not familiar with git, email Nisha
or talk to a CS major in Ram's Head. :)
